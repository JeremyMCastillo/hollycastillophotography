						<h2>
							Hello. My name is Holly Castillo.
						</h2>
					</div>
					<p>
						I believe in a thing called love. There is truth in the saying, &quot;Do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life&quot;. I truly love what I do- because I am granted the opportunity to capture and preserve the love that's shared between families. Husband to wife, mother to child, brother to sister- the love shared between people brings still images to life, and I am constantly humbled by being able to take part in capturing it.
				   <br />
				   <br />
				   When not photographing beautiful people and families, I can be found listening to the Avett Brothers, eating Mexican food (mainly guacamole), and snuggling my husband and our four cats.

                                    Sometimes I love these guys so much that I just want to smush their little faces. I'm told this is something called &quot;cuteness aggression&quot;.

                                I'm a strong believer in natural emotions. Natural smiles, natural laughter, natural silliness. On shoots you will often hear me say &quot;Do whatever feels comfortable for you&quot;. My favorite images are those taken when a couple is laughing at an inside joke, or a toddler is giving me his grumpy &quot;I don't want to take pictures anymore&quot; face. As I said before, I believe in a thing called love. And love shines through best when we can naturally express ourselves.
